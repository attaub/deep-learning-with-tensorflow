# deep-learning-with-tensorflow

This repository is based on the code base porvided by [handson-ml2][https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2] and focuses only on the deep learning part of it, thus including chapter10-chapter17. I prefer code in scripts instead of jupyter notebooks, thus refactoring the entire notebook contents into a scripts is a fun exercise as well as it allowes a better understanding of the content.
